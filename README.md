As a programming enthusiast I have always dreamt of developed code that, despite being easy to follow, is incredibly complex.

I stumbled across organic AI and believed that it may hold the key to general purpose AI development.
I hope to be able to convert the Python variant into a C program for increased efficiency and perhaps pipeline the neurons.
However, for the time being, Python will perform at an acceptable rate and I will gladly sacrifice the program's speed for ease of flow.

I am going into this topic without research (other than understanding the basic principles of AI) and so, though my knowledge may be lacking, will serve as an example of my logic problem solving skills.

Thank you for reviewing.
